Know, Celin, since thou m ιο prend,
'Twns Ι that gave thee thy reum z
Thou hadst in the for-gottern crowd
Os common benuties liv⁷d unknown,
Had not nty 'verse exhal'd thy nume,
And with it imped the wings of fume-

Thac killing power is none of thine,
Ι gave it to thy voice md oyen
Thy sweets, thy graecu, all use mine3
Thou art my star, shin'st in my ukieu.
Thon dart not from thy borrow'd sphere
Lightniug on him that fix‘d thee there.

Wishes.

Sweet be her ἀπαιτῇς, the sair, the young;
Graec, beauty, breathe upon her3

Music, haunt thou about her tongue;
Life, fill her path with honour.

All golden thoughts, all weaIth oi* days,
Truth, sriendship, love sun-ound hen

So may she smile till life be estosed,
And angel-hands have crown'rl her.
