26⁶ SABRINAE COROLLA.

Paos the stream—before thee lies
All the conquered land os glory:
Hark what songs of rapturo rise3
These proclaim the victor’s story3
Soldier, lay thy weapons down,
Quit the sword, and take the crown;
Triumph! all thy foes are banished,
Death is slain, and earth has vonished.

Omnoom Enmnm.

Heaven.

This world is all a fleeting show,
For man's illusion given ;

The smiles of joy, the tears of noe,

Deceitful shine‚ deceitsul fl0w3
There’s nothing true but Heaven.

And false the light on glory’s plume
As fading hues of even ;
And love, and hope, and beouty's bloom,
Are blossoms gother’d for the tomb;
There 's nothing bright but Heaven.

Poor wanderers os a stormy day,
From wave to wave we're dsiven,

And fancy’s flash and reason’s ray
Serve but to light the troubled way3

There 's nothing calm but Heaven.
Moonn.
