SABRINAE COROLLA.

Tlre coming Jodgment.

The world is grown old, and her pleasures are past3
The world is grown old, and her form may not last3
The world is grown old, and trernbles for sear:

For sorrows aboundâ€š and judgment is near.

The sun in the heaven is languid and pale,
And feeble and few are the fruits of the vale5
And the hearts of the natione fail thern for sear:

For the world is grown old, and judgment is near.

The king on his throne, the bride in her bower,
The children os ploasure. all feel tho sod hour3
The roses are farled, and tasteless the eheer:

For the world is grown old, and judgment is near.

The world is grown old: but should we complain,
Who have tried her, and know that her promise is vain?
Our heart is in heaven, our honre is not here,

And we loolr for our crown when judgment is near.

Honnn.

Epiron} .

The thorny patho os life awhile she trod,
Thon gently closed her eyeS, ond saw her God.
