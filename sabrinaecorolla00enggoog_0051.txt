Idyz.

Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain heigh23
For Love is of the valley3 come thou down,
And find him by the happy threshold, he,
Or hand in hand with Plenty iu the maize,
Or red with spirtcd purple of the vato,
Or fox-like in the vine3 nor cures to walk
With Death and Morm‘ng on the silver homs3
Nox wilt thou mue him in the white ravine,
Nur find him dropt upon the fittlu οἰ ice,
That huddling sluut in furrow-eloven falls
To roll the torrent out of dusky deors.
But follow: let the torrent danae thee down
To find him in the valley3 let the wild
Lenn-headed eagles yelp alone, md leuve
The monstrans ledgee there ω slope, and spill
Their thousand wreatbs of dnngling waterssmoke,
That, like ι broken purpose, waste in air:
So waste not thou, but come; for all the vale·
Amic thee; azure pium of the hearth
Arise to thee3 the children call5 and I
Thy shepherd pipe, and sweet is every mund,—
Sweeter thy voice, but every sound is sweetz
Myriads of rivulets hurrying through the lauru,
The moon of devea in immemorial elma,
And murmuring of innumernble bees.
