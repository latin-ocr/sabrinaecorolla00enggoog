2³4 , SABRINAE COROLLA.

Ah, in those halls sor us thou wilt not mourn;
Far are the AEsar's joys from human woe 3

But not the less forsalren and forlorn
Those thou hast left belovr.

N ever, oh never more shall we behold thee,
The last spark dies upon the sacred hearth:
Art thou less lost, though heavenly arms enfold thee —
Art thou less lost to earth?

Slow swells the sorrowing Naenia's chaunted enain,
Time with slow flutes our leaden footsteps keep ;
Sad earth, whate'er the happier heaven may gain,
Hath but a loss to weep.

She is not fair to outward view:
As many maidens be3
Her loveliness Ι never knew
Until she smiled on me:
Oh, then l saw her eye was bright3
A well of love-a spring of light.

But now her looks are coy and sold,
To mine they ne’er reply;
And yet Ι cease not to behold
The love-light in her eye :
Her very frowns are better far
Than smiles of other maidens are.
