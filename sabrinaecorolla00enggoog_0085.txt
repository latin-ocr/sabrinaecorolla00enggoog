Ever round your xnidnight bed
Han-ld sprites shall haunt yon.

Η. Ι’11 wed another, like my deur,
Nancy, Naneyz
Then all hell will fly for sear,
My sponse Naney.

To Phyllis.

Phyllis, why should we delny

Pleasures shnrter than the day?

eould we (which we never can)

Streoeh our lives beyond their span,

Beauty like a shadow flies,

And our youth before us dies:

Or, would youth and beauty stay,

Love hnth wings, aud will away.

Leve bath swifter wings than Time ς

Change in Leve to heav'n does climb;

Gods, that never change their state,

Vary ost their love und hate.
Phyllis! to this truth we owe

All the love betwixt us two.

Let not you and I inquire

What has been our past desire;

On what shepherd you have smfled,

Or what nymphs I have beguiled ι

Leave it to the pla-net! too

What we shall hereafter do:

For the joys we now may prove,

Take advice os present love.

WALuu.
