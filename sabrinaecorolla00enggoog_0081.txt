And heurts shall adore thee,
And bend at thy alu-imm
But none bow before thee
So truly as mine.
Sum-ur.

Jepmha's Daughter.

Since our country, our God, 0 my rire,
Demaud that thy daughter expire;

Since thy triumph was bought by thy ww,—
Strike the bosom that's bared for thee now!

And the voice of my mourning is o’er,
And the mouumins behold me no more:
If the hand that I love lay me low,
There cannot be pain in the blow!

And os this, O my father, be sure,—

Thut the blood os thy child is as pure

As the blessing 1 beg ere it flow,

And the last thought that mothes me below*

W'hen the virgins οἰ Salem lumeut,
Be the judge and the hero unbent!
I have won the great battle sor thee,
And my father and country are free !

When this blood of thy giving luth gush'd,
When the voice that thou lovest is hush'd,
Let my mcmory still be thy pride,
And surget unt I smiled aa 1 died!
Bruma
