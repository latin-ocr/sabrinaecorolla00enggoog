m Rome.

As late euch flower that sweetest blowu
1 plucked, the garden’s pride,
Within the petals of a rose
A deeping Leve 1 spied.

Around his brom a beamy wreath
Οἱ many a lucent hum

All purple glowed his cheek benenth,
Inebriate with dew.

Ῑ wftly mized the unguas-ded Power,
Nor seared his balmy rest;

And placed him, caged within the flower,
On spetiem Sanss bremt.

But when, uuweeting of the guile,
Awoke the prisoner ποεῖ,

He ntruggled to escape awhile,
And flmmped his saery feet.

Ah, mou the soul-entraneing sight
Subdued the impuient b0y3

He φηθεὶς he thrilled with deep defight;
Then clapped hia wings sor joy.
