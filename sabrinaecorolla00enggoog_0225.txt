1⁹4 SABMNAE COROLLA. ι

The Architect (μ’ Hell.

The ascending pile
swod fixed her sutely height; aud straight the dom-s,
Opening their brazen snlds, discover wide
Withiu her ample spaces, o'er the smooth
And level pavement: from the arched root,
Pendent by subtle magio, many a row
Of stan-ry lamps, and bluzing cremet-³, fed
With naphtha and asphaltus, yielded light
As from a sky. The hasty multitude
Admiring enver⁷d ς and the work some praise,
And some the architect : his hand was known
In heaven by many a tower'd structure high,
Where sceptred angela held their msideme,

And snt ns princes; whom the supreme King
Exn-lter] to such power, and gave tn rule,
Eaeh in his hierarchy, the orders bright.
Nur was his name unheard or unndored
In ancient (ἔτεκες and in Ausonian land
Men call‘d him Mulciben and how he fell
From heaven, they sahled, thrown by augry Jove
Sheer o'er the crystal battlements: from mom
To noon he fell, from neon to dewy eve,
A summer's day; und with the setting sun
Dropp'd from the zenith like a falling star,
On Lemnos, the AEgean isle: thus they relate,
Erring3 for he with this rebellium tout
Fell long besore; nor aught avail'd him now
To have built in heaven high mowers3 nor did he scape
By all his engines, but was headlong sent
With his iudustrious crew ιο build in hell.
Maron
