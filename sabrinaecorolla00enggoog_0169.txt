The Selilary Poet.

There was a Poet, whose untimely lomb

No human hands with piem revel-enee rear'd.

But the chnrm'd eddies of autumnal vinds

Built o'er his mouldering bones a pyrmid

of mouldering leaves in the waste wildemessz

Δ lovely youth! No mouming {miden deek'd

With weeping flowers, or votive cypress wreath,

The lone conch of his everlasting deep z

Gentle, and breve, and generans, no lom ban-d

Breathed o'er his dark sate one melodious niglu:

Ηε lived, he died, he sung in solitude.

Strangers have wcpt ιο hear his passionum note: ς

And virgins, as unknown he past, have sigh'd

And wastnd for fond Iove of his wild eyes.

The fite os those soft orbs has ceased tu burn,

And Silence, too enanmur'd of that voice,

Iocks its mute music in her rugged cell.
Suu-ur.

Inscriptionfor a Lightlmme.

Far in the bosom os the deep,
O'er these wild shelves my wateh 1 keep;
A ruddy gem of changesul light
Bound nn the dusky brow of night:
The scm-nan bida my lusere hail,
And seems to atrike hin timorous ui]-
Sem-r.
