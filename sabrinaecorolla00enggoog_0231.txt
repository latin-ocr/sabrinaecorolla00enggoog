200 SABRINAE COROLLA.

Milton.

Milton! thou should'st be living at this hour3
England hath need os thee; she is a fen
Of stagnant waters3 altar, sword, and pen,
Fireside‚ the heroic wealth of hall and boner,
Have forfeited their ancient English dower
Of inward happiness. We arc selfish men:
Oh! raise us up, return to us again,
And give us manners. virtue, freedom, power.
Thy soul vvas like a star, and dwelt apart3
Thou had’st a voice whose sound was like the sea3
Pure as the naked heavens, majestic‚ free.
So didst thou travel on life's common way
In cheerful godliness3 and yet thy heart
The lowliest duties on herself did loy.

The absent Rosa.

Why is it that on Clara’s lace

The lily only has a place?

Is it that the absent rose

Is gone to paint her husband’s nosel
