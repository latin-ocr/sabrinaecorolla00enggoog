98 SABRINAE COROLLA.

The World's Woadcrers.

Tell me, thou Star, whose wings of light
Speed thee in thy fiery flight,
In what cavern of the night

Will thy pinions close now?

Tell me, Moon, thou pale and grey

Pilgrim of heaven's homeless way,

In what depth of night or day
Seekest thou repose now l

Weary Wind, who wanderest
Like the world's rejected guest,
Hast thou still some secret nest

On the tree or billow l
Snrnrrr.

Contentment.

l care not, Fortune, what you me deny:

You cannot rob me of free Nature’s grace ;

You cannot shut the windows of the sky,

Through which Aurora shews her brightening face3
You cannot bar my constant feet to trace

The woods and lawns, by living stream, at eve.

Let health my nerves and finer fibres brace,

And Ι their toys to the great children leave:

Of fancy, reason, virtue, nought can me bereave.

Taonson.
