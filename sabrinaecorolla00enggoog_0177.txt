Go, lovely rose,

Tell her that wastes her time ¹md me,
Thac now she kuows,

When I resemble her to thee,

How sweet mul fair she seems to be.

Tell her thut's young,
And shuns to have lucr graces spied,
That, harlst thou sprung
In deserts where no men abide,
Thou must have uncummended died.

Small is the worth

Of benuty from the light retis-ed:
Bid her come forth,

Suss'er herself to be desired,

And not blush so to be admired.

Then die; that she
'she common sate of an things rau-e
May rond iu thoe,
How small a part of time they share,
That arc so wondrous swect nnd fair.

Wnun.
