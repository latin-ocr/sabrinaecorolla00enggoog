SABRINAE connum.

Lamentation-

Swifter far than summer-'s ssight,
Swister far than youth's delight,
Swifter fur than happy night,

Art thou come and gone.
As the earth when leaves are dead,
As the night when sleep is sped,
Aa the beart when joy is fled,

I um lest lone, alone.

The swalluw summer comes agaim
The owlet night resumes her reign;
But the wild swan youth is fain

Το fly with thee, false as thou.
My heare each day desitos the morrow,
Sleep itself is turned to sorrow,
Vainly would rny winter borrow

Sunuy leaves from any bough.

Lilies for n brida] bed,
Rosea for n matron's head,
Violets for a muideu dead,—
Pansies lot my flnwers be:
On the living grave 1 bear
Scattcr them without ε teau
Let no friend, however clear,
Waste one hope, one fem· sor me.
