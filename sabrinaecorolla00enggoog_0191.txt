Marion.

Will γε gae to the ewe-bughts, Marion,
And wear in the sheep wi· me?

The sun ahiae: ενι-εει, my Marion,
But uae half ue sweet u thee.

Oh, Marion'n a bonhie lan,

And the blythe blink's in her ἑᾶς
And {ain wad I mun-y Mation,

Gin Marion wad marry me.

I've nine milch ewes, my Marion,
A cow, and a brnwnie quey;
I'sc gie them ει* to my Marion
Just on her brida! day.
Οιιι Scor-nun Sauo.

Tlte Indiam Tree.

They tell us of an Indian trec,
Which, howsoe'er me sun and sky
May tempt im boughs to wnnder free,
And shoot aud blossom wide and high,
Yet better loves tu bend its arms
Downwards again to that dem· eru-th,
From which the life, that filla und warms
Iu! grateful being, first had birth.
E'en thus, though woo'd by flntteriug friends,
And sed with fame (is sume it be),
This henrt, my nwn dem· mother, hendo
With luve's true instinct back to thee.
