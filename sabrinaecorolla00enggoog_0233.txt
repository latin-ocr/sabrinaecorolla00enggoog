202 SABRINAE COROLLA.

T le Recol.

Come again, come again!

Sunshine cometh after rain.

As a lamp fed newly humeth,
Pleasure‚ who doth fly, remmoth,
Scattering every cloud of pain.

As the year, which diesin showers,
Riseth in a world of flowers,

Call’d by many a vernal strain,
Come thou, for whom tears were falling,
And a thousand tongues are calling3
Come again, oh come again!

Like the sunshine after rain.

Biasr Commi.

——Q—

Sonnet.

Shall Ι compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:

Rough winds do shake the derling huds of May,

And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,

And often is his gold complexion dimm'd3

And every fair from fair sometime declines,

By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimm'd.
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,

Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest3

Nor shall Death hrag thou wander'st in his shade,
When in eterna] lines to time thou growest:

So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,

So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
