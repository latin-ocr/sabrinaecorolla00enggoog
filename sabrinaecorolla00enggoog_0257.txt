226 SABRINAE COROLLA.

He end She.

He. What the bee is to the floweret‚

When he looks for honey-dew
Through the leaves that close embower it, ·
Thu, my love, I’ll be to you.

She. What the bank, with verdure glowing,
Ι s to waves that wander near, ·
Whispering kisses, while they're going,
That I’ll be to you, my dear.

She. But they say, the bee's a rever,
That he'll fiy when sweets are gone3
And, when once the kiss is over,
, Faithless brooks will wander on.

He. Nay, if flowers will lose their looks,
If sunny banks will wear away,

‘Tis but right that bees and brooks
should sip and kiss them while they may.

Moosse.

A Dialogue.

Sweet rose of May, sweet rose of May,
Whither, ah whither fied away 2-
Whet’s gone no time can e'er restore:
j Ι come no more—I come no more.
