 

SABMNAE COROLLA.

The Siege qs Corinth.

'Tis midnight: nn the munumina brown
The cold round moon :hines deeply (10qu
Blue roll the waters, blue the sky
Sprendfl like an ocean hung on high,
Bespangled with those isles οἱ light,

So wildly, spiritually bright;

Who ever gazed upon them shining,

And tum'd to earth without repining,
Nur wish'd for wings tu flee awny,

And mix with their etei-nal ray 2

The waves ou either shore lay there
Calui, clear, and azure as the air3

And marce their fuam the pebbles shook,
But murmur‘d meekly aa the brook.

The winds were pillow'd on the waves;
The bannens droup'd along their naves,
And, as they fell nround them furling,
Above them shnne the crescent curling;
And that deep silence was unbroke.

Save where the watch hi. signal spoke,
Save where die nteed neigh'd oft and alu-ill,
And echo unswer‘d from the hill,

And the wide hum of that wild host
Rustled like leaves from coast to coast,
As rose the Muezzin'u voice in nix,

111 midnight call tn wanted prnyer;

It rose, that chame-⁴1 mournful strnin,
Like some lone spirit's o'er the plain:
'Twas musical, but sudly nweel,

Such aa when winda and hnrp-strings meet,
