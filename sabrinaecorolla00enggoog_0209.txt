Tame, oh take those tipo away.

Tuke, oh take those lips away,
That ιο sweetly were forswom ;

Ami thone eyes, the break of day,
Lights that do mislead the mom :

But my kima bring :gain-1,

Seals of love, but scaled in vain.

Hide, oh hide those bins of suow,
Which thy srozen bosom bem,
On whose tops the pinks that grow
Are of those that April wean :
But first set my poor hem free,
Bouml iu those icy chains by thee.
Summo.

Inscriplion on a Boat.

They say that I am small und (ΠΗ,
And cannot live in stormy fleas.
It may be so; yet every sail
Makes shipwreck in the swelling breeze.

Nor strength nor size cau then hold fast.
But Fortune's favour, Henven's decl-ee.
Let others trust in oar and mast,
But may the gods «ake care of me!

G. Mzmvns (sm tlte Greek).
