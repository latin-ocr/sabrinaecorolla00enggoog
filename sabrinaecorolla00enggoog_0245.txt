214 SABRINAE conomm.

A Farewell.

Flow down, cold rivulet, to the sea,
Thy tribute-wave deliver;

No more by thee my steps shall be,
For ever and for ever.

Flow, softly ssew, by lawn and lea,
A rivulet, then a river3

No where by thee my steps shall be,
For ever and for ever.

But here will sigh thine elder-mee,
And here thine aspen shiver,

⁵ And here by thee will hum the bee,

For ever and for ever.

A hundred suns will stream on thee,
A thousand moons will quiver3

But not by thee my steps shall be,

For ever and for ever.
Temseu.

Epitaph.

What thou art reading o'er my bones
I 've often read on other stones;

And others soon shall read of thee

What thou art reading now of me.
