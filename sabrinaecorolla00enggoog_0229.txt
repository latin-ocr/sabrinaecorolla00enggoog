198 SABRINAE COROLLA.

The Poet’s Song,

The rain had fallen3 the Poet arose,
And pass’d by the town, and out of the street,
A light wind blew from the gates of the sun,
And waves of shadow went over the wheat.'
And he sat him down in a lonely place,
And chanted a melody loud and sweet,
That made the wild swan pause in her cloud,

And the lark drop down at his feet.

The swallow stopt as hc hunted thc bee,
The snake slipt under a spray,

The wild hawk stood with the down on his bcak,
And stared with his foot on the prey;

And the nightingale thought: Ι have sung many songs,
But never a one so gay3

For he sings of what the world will be

When the years have died away.
Tannrson.

'Lines ia α Lady's Albam.

Small service is true service, while it lasts3 ·
of humblest friends, bright creature, scorn not one:
. The daisy, by the shadow which it casts,
Protects the lingering dewdrop from the sun.
