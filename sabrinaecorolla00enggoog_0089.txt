Telle est la We.

Seest thou yon ban-k? It left our bay

Thi» mom οιι its advent-:rous way,
All glad and gaily bright;

And many u gale its impulse gave,

And many a genssy-henviug wave
Nigh bore it out of sight.

But soon that glorious course was lost,
And treacherous wax the deep;

Ne'er thought they there was peril most
When tempest aeemed asleep.

Tene est la vie!

That flower, that fairest flower that grew,
Aye chorished by the eveuing dew,
And cheered by opening dny3
'rhat flower, which I had spaxed to eull,
Because it was so beautiful,
And shone so fresh and gam
ΗΜ, all unseen a deathly ὡσοὶ,
The germ os futuxe snrrow;
And there was emker ut its root,
Thac uipped it ere the mon-tow.
Telle est la vie!

I’ve wamhed frum yonde'r mountain's height
The waxing aud the waning light,
The world far, far below;
I've heard the thunder lbng and loud,
I've seen the suuxhine and the cloud,
The tempest aad the bow5
