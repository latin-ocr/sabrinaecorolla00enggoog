Freedom.

Yon uk me why, though ill ut ease,
Within this reg-ion 1 aubsist,
Whose spirits fail within the mint,

And hmguish for the purple seu.

It is the land that freemen till,

Thac sober-suited Freedom choen

The land, where gitt with friend.- οι foen,
A mm may speak the thing he wilh

A lund of settled govemmcnt,

A land ofjust and old renown,

W'here Freedom broadens slowly down
From precedent. to precedent.

Should bande-⁴1 uniom persecute
Opinion, and induce a time
When single thought is civil crime,
And individual freedom mutu

Though Power should make frum Lami ω land
The nume of Britain trebly grean
Though every chamuel in the state

Should dmost choke with golden md 5—

Yet wast me from the barbam-mouth,
Wild wind! 1 seek a warmer sky ς
And I wiss see before I die

The palum and temples of the South.
Τεωπεοκ.
