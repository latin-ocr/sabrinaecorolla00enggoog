Song os Comus,

The stu· that bias the thepherd feld,
Now the top of heaven doth hold3
And the gilded cns of day

His glowing axle dod: allay

In the steep Atlantia streanu

And the slope nun his upwasd beun
Shoots against the dusky pole,

Pacing toward the other goul

Of his chumber in the east.
Meanwhile, welcome joy md feast,
Midnight about and γενεῦ-γ,

Tipsy donee aud jofflty.

Braid you: locku with rnsy twine,
Droppiug odom-s, dsopping wine.
Rigour now is gone to bed,

And advice with scrupulum head,
Strict age ancl smu- severity,

With their grave saws, in slumber lie.
We, that are us pure: fite,

Imitate the nal-ry quire,

Who in their ssightly watehful spherea
Lewd in swist round the months md γεω.

Mum.
