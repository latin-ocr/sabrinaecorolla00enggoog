1ss summm: con-OLLA.

T lte Spirit os Love.

A Spirit there is, whose fragrant sigh
Is buming now through earth md nir:
Whexe cheeks are hlushing, the Spin-it is nigh;
Where lips nte meeting, the Spirit is there !

His brath is the toul of flowers like themu
And his flonting eyes‚-- oh, they resemble
Blue water-filies, when the breeze
Is making the stream around them tremble!

Hm to thee, hail to thee, kindling power!
Spirit of love! Spirit of bliss!
Thy holiest time is the moonlight hour,
And there never was moonlight w sweet aa this,

By the sair and brave, who blushing unite,

Like the sun and wave when they meet at night!
By the teus that shews when passion is nigh,

As the uin-drop flows stom the hene of the nky!

By the first love-beat of the youthful heum

By the bliss to meet, and the pain to part!

By all that thou hast ιο murtals given,
Which—oh, could it lust, this earth were heaven!

We call thee hither, entrancing power!
Spirit of love! Spixit of bliss!
The huliest time is the muonlight haur,
And there never was moonlight w sweet aa this!

Moont.
