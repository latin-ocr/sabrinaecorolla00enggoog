SABlthAE COROLLA.

My Notioe Stream.

Pure stream, in whose transparent ware

My youthful lirnbs I wont totove,

No torrents stain thy lirnpid source,

No rocks irnpede thy dimpling course:

Devolving from thy parent lake,

A charming rnazo thy waters make,

By bowers of birch‚ and groves of pine,

And hedges flower’d with eglantine.
Still on thy bankS, so gaily green,

May numerous herds and floclrs bo seen,

And lassos chanting o'er the pail,

And shepherds piping in the dale,

And ancient saith that knows no guile,

And industry enrbrown’d with teil,

And hearts resolved, and hands prepared,

The blessings they enjoy to guard.

Snorrrrrr.

Melody.

How deor to me the hour when daylight dies,
And sunbeams molt along the silent sea!

For then sweet dreonrs of other days arise,
And nrernory breathes her vesper sigh to thee.

And as Ι natclr the line of light that plays
Along the srnooth wave toward the burning west,
Ι long to troad that golden path of rays,

And think ’twould lead to sorno bright isle of rest.
Moonr.
