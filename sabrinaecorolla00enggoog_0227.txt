Eve.

With thee eonversing, Ῑ forge! au time,

ΑΗ senone, and their ehange; all plesse alike.

Sweet in the breuth of mom, her rising sweet,

With cham of earliest birds; pleasant the sun,

When first on this delightful land he spreads

His orient bearna, on herb, tree, fruit, and fimet,

Glistering with dew : fragrant the senile earth

After eost showers3 and sweet the coming on

Of grateful eveniug milch then silent night,

With this her solemn bird ; and this fair moon,

And these the genu of heaven, her starry traim

But neither bresith of mern, when she ascends

With charm of earliest birds; nor rising sun

On this delightful lauth nor herb, fruit, flower,

Glistering with dew3 nor fragrance after showers3

Nor grateful evening mild3 nor silent night,

With this her solemn bix-<13 nor walk by moon,

Or glittering star-light, without thee is sweet.
Min-ou.
