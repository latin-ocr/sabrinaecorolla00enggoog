snnnmnn COROLLA.

Thy Doyr ore done.

Thy days are done, thy fame begun3
Thy country’s strains record
, The triumphs of her chosen son,
The slaughters of his sword;
' The deeds he did, the fields he won,
The freedom he restored.

Though thou art fallen, while we are free,
Thou shalt not toste of deoth3

The generous blood that fiow'd from thee
Disdoined to sinlr beneoth:

Within our veins its currents be,
Thy spirit on our breath.

Thy name, our charging hosts along,
Shall be the battle-word 3

Thy fall, the theme of choral song
From virgin voices poured.

To weep would do thy glory wrong;

Thou shalt not be deplored.
Brnon.

Sigh no more, Lodier.

Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more:
Men were deceivers ever.
One foot on sea, one foot on shore3

To one thing constant never.
Smsrrlnr.
