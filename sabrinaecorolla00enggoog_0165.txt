SABRINAB COROLLA⁴

Winter.

The mill-wheel’s fromn in the stream,
The church is deek'd with h011y;

Mistletoe hange from the kitcheu-beam,
To fright away mehucholy;

Ieicles clink in the milknmid's pail,
Younkers alate on the pool below,

Blackbirds perch on the guden-mil:
And hask, how the eold winds blow!

There goes the equire to shuot at suipe ;
Here runs Dick to setch a l⁰g;
You'd swear his brenth was the smoke of a pipo
In the srosty morning sog.
Hodge is breaking the ive for the kine ς
Old and young cough as they 3⁰5
The round red sun forgets to shiue;
And hark, how the eold winds blow!
Homer: Smm.

Limsrom tlte German.

Let me wander where she wnlks
In the blensed calm os even3

Let me listen when she taikn
Jove, 1 envy not thy heaven.

Love within my bosom's cell
Hermu-like deth ever dwell:

Hope and Joy may leuve my heart ς
Leve and 1 will never part.
