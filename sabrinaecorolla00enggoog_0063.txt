The Slony Heort.

W'henee comes my love, 0 henne, discluse!
'Twas from her cheeks that §hume the rose ;
From lips that spuyle the rubie'a prayue3
From eyes that mock the diamnnd's blaze.
Whenee comet my woe, aa freely owue:
Ah, mel 'twas from a beart lyke stone.

The blushyng cheek speakes modest mynde,
The lips befltting wordes most kynde3

The eye does tempte to love's desyre,

And seems to say, 'tis Cupid's fite z

Yet all so faire but speake my monne,

Syth noughte dothe suye the henrte of stone.

Why ssms, my love, so kyndely speake
Sweet lyppe, swect eye, sweet blushynge cheeke,
Yet not a heurte to save my paine?
Ο Venus! take thy gistes again ς
Makc not so seire to cause our monne,
Or make a hemo thut's like our owne.
