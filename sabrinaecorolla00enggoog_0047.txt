1 nm thee περ.

1 saw thee weep—the big bright teu
Came o'er that eye of Μῦες

And then methought iv. did appear
A violet dsopping dew:

1 saw thee mile—the sapphixe's blane
Redde thee ceued to shine;

12 could not match the living ruys
Thnt ffll’d that glauce of thine.

As clouds from youcler sun receive
A deep md mellow die,

Which scm-ce the nhnde of coming eve
Cn bmish frum the sky3

Those smiles into the moodiest mind
Their own pure joy impaxt;

Their sumshine leaves a glow behind

That lightens o'er the beart,

The Imitatur.

Au mow from a bow just ahot,

Flew upwud to henven's cmopy,

And cried, with pompous aelf-conceit,

To the king engle, neumfully,

Imok here !—·I cm us high a! thou,

And, towusds the suu, even higher ³⁸51!

The engle miled, and said, O foul,

What do thy bon-owed plumes mil?

By othen' strength thou dost ascend,

But by thyself dost dowuwasd vend.
