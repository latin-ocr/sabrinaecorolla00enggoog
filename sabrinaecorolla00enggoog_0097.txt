G! SABRINAE COROLLA.

For by thy gracie-1⁸ gohier! glittering strenuus,
I trust to mne os tmest Thisby's sight.
But stay-0 spite Ξ
But mark—poor knight,
What dreadsul dole is bere?
Eyes, do you see?
How can it be ἲ
0 dainty duck! O ‹lem-¹.
Thy mantle good,
What. stained with blood 2
Approach, ye furies fell !
O satos, come, come!
Cut thread, und thrum!
Quail, anah, conclude, and quell!

Ο ῠνειιίΙιε not his Numa.

0 breathe not his name, let it sleep in the shade
Where cold and unhonour'd his relies are 1aid;

Sad, silent, and dtu-k be the tems that we shed,

As the night-dew that falls on the grass o'er his head!

But the night-dew that falls, though in silence it weeps,
Shffl brighton with verdum the grave where he sleeps3
And the tear that we shod, though in sceret it rolla,
Shall long keep his memory green in our mula.
