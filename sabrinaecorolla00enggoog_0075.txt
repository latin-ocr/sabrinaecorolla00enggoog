 

4² SABRINAE COROLLA.

The Fortunate Lami.

Know'at thou the land, where hangs the citron-fltrwer,
Where glenus the golden orange in the bower,
W'here gentle zephyr· in the blue sky play,
And myrtles ereep beneath the towering buy ἓ
Know'st thou indeed?
Oh there, oh there
Would Ι with thee, my best-beluved, speed.

Know'et thou the house, that rests on columns ull,
Iu gay saloon, iu glitt'ring bmquet-hall,
Where muble statues stand and gaze on rue :—
What have they done, thou lupless child, to thee?
Know'st thou indeed?
oh there, 011 there
Would 1 wiss thee, my own kind guardien, speed.

Know'et thou the mount, ami its cloud-erested sheep,
Where poring mules the misty pathwny keep ;
In caves the dragou hides her ancient brood;
Down leupo the roek, md over it the flend?

Know'st thou indeed?

Oh there, oh there
Our journey teuds3 my father, let uz speed.
