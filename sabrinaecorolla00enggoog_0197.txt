SA numu: conum-A.

The Dal-ry*

There is a ssower, u little flower,
wnh silves erest and goldo„ eye,

'fluat welcemes every ehanging hour,
And westhcrs every sky.

The prouder beauties uf the field
ιιι gay but quick successio„ smne,
Race after mee their honours yield,
They fluurish and decline.

But this small fluwcr, tu Nature dear,
While monus und sun-s their courses run,

Wreuthes the whole circle os the year,
Compmfion of the sun.

lt smiles upon thc lap of May,

To sultry August spreads its channs,
Lights pale October un his way,

Ami twines Deeember's arms.

The purple heath und gulde„ broom
On moory mountains match the gelu

O‘er bwns the lily sheds perfume,
The violet in the vale,

But this bold flow'ret climbs the hill,
Hides iu the forest, haunts the glen,
Plays on the margin os the rill,
Peeps round the sox's den.
