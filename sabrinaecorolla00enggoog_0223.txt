To a Fanum Mfflreu.

1 loved thee once, I’ll love no morsu
Thine be the grief, aa thiae the blame t

Thou art not what thou wast before:
What reason Ι should be the same?

He that can love unloved again

nath better stote of love than hrain:

God send me love my debr-s to puy,

While umbrisne 5001 their love away.

Nothing could have my love o'erthrown,
If thou hndnt still continued mine;
Yon, if thou ’ἀει still remained thino own,
I might perchauee have yet been thino:
But thou thy freedom didst recall,
Tha: it thou mighmt elsewhere enthrnl3
And then how could 1 but disdnin
Δ captive's captive to romain? ⁴
Δι’-τουπ.

Epitaplt qf a Quarrelsome Woman.

Here lies, thank Heaven, a woman who
Quanelled and aton-:ned her whole life through :
Trcad gently o'cr her mouldering form,
Or else you'll ronse another storm.
