Alcides.

Alcides thus his rece began:

O'er infancy he swiftly ran :

The futuro god at first was more than man.
Dangers and toils and J uno’s hate

E’en o'er his cradle lay in weit,

And there he grappled first with fate:

In his young hand the hissing snakes he pressed;
So early was the deity confessed.

Thus by degrees he rose to Jove’s imperial seat:
Thus difficulties prove a soul legitimately great.

Tne Narcissus

Ι saw the pride of all the mendose, ’
At monn a gay narcissus blow
Upon a river's bank, whose shadow
Bloomed in the silver waves below.
By noontide‘s heat its youth was wasted,
The waters as they passed complained;
At eve its glories all were blasted‚
And not one former grace remained.
While the mild rose, more safely growing
Low in the unaspiring vale,
Amidst retirement's shelter blmving,

Long sheds its sweetness on the gale.
Oownsn.
