The Lotus-caten.

Hateful is the dnrk-blue sky
Vnulted o'er the dark-blue sea.
Death is the end of life3 ah, why
Should life all labour be Ζ
Let us alone. Time driveth onward saut,
And in a little while our lips axe dumh.
Let us alone. What is it that will lust ?
All things ure taken from us, and become
Pordona md parcels os the dreadsul pann
Iaet us alone. What pleusure cm we have
To war with evil? Is there any peuce
In ever climbing up the climbing wne?
All things have rest, and ripen toward the grave
ln silence, ripen, fall, and cense-

Give us long rest, οι- death, dask death, or dseamful
ease·
