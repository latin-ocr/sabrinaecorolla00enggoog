Satyrnae.

His loving mother came upon a day

Unto the woodes to see her little sonne3

And chaunst unwares to meet him in the way,

After his sportes and cruell pastime donne3

When after him a lyonesse did runne,

That roaring all with rege did lowd requere

Her children deare, whom he away had wonne:

The lyon whelpes she saw how he did beare,
And lull in rugged arms withouten childish feare.

The fearefull dame all quaked at the sight,
And turning bache gan fast to fly away;
Untill‚ with love revokt from vaine affiight,
She hardly yet perswaded evas to stay,
And then to him these womanish words gan say:
“ Ah, Satyrane, my dearling and my ioy,
For love of me leave off this dreadfull play 3
To dolly thus with death is no fit toy:
Go, find some other play-fellones, mine own sweet boy.”

Jack his own merit sees3 this gives him pride,
For he sees more than all the world beside.
