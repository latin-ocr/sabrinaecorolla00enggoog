922 SABRINAE COROLLA.

To the Genius oftlze House.

Command the roof, great Genius, and from thence
Into this house pour down thy inflnenoe,

That through each room a golden pipe may run
Of living water by the benizon;

Fulfil the larders, and by strength’ning bread

Be evermore thy bins replenished.

Next, like a bishop, consecrate my ground,

That lncky fairies here may (lance their round3
And, after that, lay down some silvei pence, ¹
The master’s charge and care to recompense3
Chnrm then the chambers3 make the bede for ease,
More than for peevish pining sicknesses3

Fix the foundation fast, and let the roof

Grow old with time, but yet keep weather-proof.

Forget T hee?

Forget thee!-bid the forest-birds forget their sweetest

Forget thffi-bid the sea forget to swell beneath the

Bid the thlilrhhhl ’flowers forget to drink the eve’s resresh·

Thyselffihlggeilhhvihe own dear land, and its mountains
wild and blue;

Forget each old familiar face, each long-remembered
s ε

When thesPeOtthings are sorgot by thee, then thou shalt

be forgot.
