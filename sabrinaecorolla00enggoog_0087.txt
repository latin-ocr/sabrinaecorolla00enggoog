SABRINAB COROLLA.

The Les-Skore.

Sleet, md hail, md thunder!
And ye winda that rave,

Tin the sanda chax-eunde:
Tinge the sulleu wave3

Winds, that Like a demon,
Howl with horricl now

Round the toiling seman
In hin tosaing bont!

From hin humble dwelling
On the shiugly shore,

Where the billows swelling
Keep such hollow ron-5—

From that weeping woman,
Seeking with her eries
Suceour superhumn
From the frowning skies 5—

Frum the urchin pining
For his father's knee 5—

From the lattice shining,
Drive lu'm out tu sea!

Let broad. lenguae dissever
Him from youder fuam.
O God! to think mm ever
Comes too neu· his home!
Hm.
