Caledonia.

0 Caledonia! ntem and wild,

Meet nurse for a poetic child ³

Laud of brown henth md shnggy wood,
Laud of the mountain and the flood.

Laud of my sires! what moml lund

Caem e'er untia the filial band

That knits me to thy rugged strand Ξ

still, as Ι view each well-known scene,
Think what is now, and what bath been,
Seems as, to me, of 211 berest,

Sole friends thy wondz und stream ue lest3
And thu} I love them better still,

Even iu extremity os ill.

By Ymow's stream still let me stray,
Though none should guide my seeble way ;
still feel the breeze down Em-iek break,
Although it chin my wither'd eheek3

Still lay my head by Teviot stone,

Though there, forgotten and alone,

The bazd may draw his parting grom-

Sem-v.

 

Enigme.
Ensant de l'Ast, enfant de lu Nature,
Plus je suis νηί, plus je suis impostum

Sans prolonger h vie, j'empfiche de mom-ir,
Et je deviens trop jeuue, ᾖ soree de vieillir.

Voumz.
