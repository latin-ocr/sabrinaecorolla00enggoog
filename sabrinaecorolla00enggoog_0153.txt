All the earth und nir
WVith thy voice ia lond,

As, when night in bare,
From one lonely cloud

The moon ruins out her bemus, md heaven ἱι over—

Silent ἰονθ-

Few the words that 1 have :pokem true love's words
are ever few 5

Yet by many a speechless taken luth my heu-t di·-
eom-sed tu you.

Souls that to ench other listen, hem· the hugunge os ι

Rend tgfflient tears that glisten iu the tendes· trembling

When §guen- cheek is pale with nminem, dhmner grows
the light uf mine,

And your smiles os sunny ghdnem in my face reflected

'I'houghffisszes'peech is saint and broken, though my word„
ase ever few,

Yet by many a voiceless taken all my hem-t in known to

you. Κ.

Lady-binl, lady-bird, ssy away home:
Your house is on fixe, your children will bum.
