The Skylark.

Ηιί] to thoe, buthe spiriu
Bird thou never vert,
Thac from heaven, or neu it,
Pourest thy full hem-t
In profuse maim of unpremedinoed nrt.

Higher m'll md highex

From the earth thou springen,
Like a cloud of ἧκες

The blue deep thou vingent,

And ningit-g still dost soar, and sowing eve! ningen.

In the golden lightning
Os the sunken sun,
O'er which clouds ate brightening,
Thou dost flout ancl run,
Like m· unbodied joy, whose tace in just begun-

The pale purple even
Melm uround thy ssight ς
Like a stu-r οἰ heaven
ln the broad daylight
Thou art unseen, but yet I hear thy slm'll delight.

Keen ns ure the mows
Os that silver sphere,
Whose intense lamp nan-own
In the white dmm clear,
Unffl we hardly see, we feel that it is there.
