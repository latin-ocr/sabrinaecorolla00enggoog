252 SABRINAE COROLLA.

The Better Laud.

I hear thee speak of the better land,

Thou callest its children a happy band:

Mother, oh where is that radiant shore3

Shall we not seek it, and weep no more?

Is it where the flower of the orange blows,

And the bre-hies donce through the myrtle·boughs i·-
Not there, not there, my child.

is it where the feathery palm-trees rise‚

And the date grows ripe under sunny skies3

Or midst the green islands of glittering seas,

Where fragrant forests perfume the breeze,

And strange bright birds on their starry wings

Bear the rich hues of all glorious things ἳ-
Not there, not there, my child.

Is it far away in some region old,

Where the river wanders o’er sands of gold,

Where the burning rays of the ruby shine,

And the diamond lights up the secret mine,

And the pearl gleams forth from the eoral strand;

Is it there, sweet mother, that better land 2-
Not there, not there, my child.

Eye bath not seen it, my gentle boy3

Ear bath not heard its deep songs of j0y3

Dreams cannot picture a world so sair,

Sorrow and death may not enter there3

Time doth not breatbe on its fadeless bloom3

For beyond the clouds and beyond the tomb,
It is there, it is there, my child.

Mrs. Hennws.
