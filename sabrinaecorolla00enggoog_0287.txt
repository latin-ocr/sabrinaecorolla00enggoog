256 SABRINAE COROLLA.

T lee Restitution os Man.

0 Son, in whom my soul hath chief delight,
Son of my bosom, Son who art alone

My word, my wisdom, and effeetual might,

All hast thou spoken as my thoughts are, all

As my eternal purpose hath deereed:

Man shall not quite be lost, but saved who will3
Yet not of will in him, but grace in me

Freely vouchsafed3 once more Ι will renew

His lapsed powerS, though forfeit, and euthrelled
By sin to foul exorbitant desires;

Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand

On even ground against his mortal foe;

By me upheld‚ that he may know how frail

His fallen conditionis, and to me owe

All his deliverance, and to none but me.
Muros.

Τ wosold Hope.

Reflected on the lahe, I love
To see the stars of evening glou,
So tranquil iu the heaven above,
So restless in the wave below.

Thus heavenly hope is all serene;
But earthly hope, how bright soe’cr,
Still flutters o'er this changing soene,
Aa salse, as fleeting, as ’tis fair.
