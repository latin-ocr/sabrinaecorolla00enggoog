2⁰8 SABRINAE COROLLA.

Anacreontio.

Underneath this myrtle shade‚

On flowery beds supinely laid,
With odorous oils my head o'erflowing‚
And around it roses growing,
What should I do but drink away
The heat and troubles of the day l
In this more than kingly state
Love himself shall on me weit.
Fill to me, Love, nay, fill it up;
And mingled cast into the cup
Wit and mirth and noble fires,

Vigorous health and gay desines.
Comus.

tte Vanity of We·

When I consider life, 'tis all a cheat3

Yet, fool'd with hope, men favour the deceit,
Trust on, and think to-morrow will repayt
To-morrow’s falser than the sonner day,

Lies worse3 and while it says, we shall he bless'd
With some new joys, cuts off what we possessed.
Strange coz'nage! none would live past years again,
Yet all hope pleasure in what yet remeia,

And from the dregs of life think to receive
What the first sprightly running could not give.
I’m tired with waiting for this chymic gold,
Which fools us young, and beggars us when old.

Damna.
