saalum COROLLA.

Ure Mariner.

Ye winda which sweep the grove’s green tops,
And hiss the mountains hoar,
Oh softly stir the ocean-waves
That sleep along the shore;
For my love sails the fairest ship
That wantons on the sea3
Oh bend his mast with pleasant gales,
And waft him hame to me.

Oh leave nae mair the bonnie glen,
Clear stream, and hawthom grove,

Where first we walked in gloaming gray,
And sighed and looked of love.

F or faithless is the ocean-mave,
And faithless is the wind3

Then leave nae mair my heart to break
’Mang Scotland's hills behind.

emm eumaeum.

To a Lady.

For me no roseate garlands twine‚
But wear them, dearest, in my stead3
Time hath a whiter hand than thine,
And lays it on my head.

llnough to know thy place on earth
Is there where reses latest die3
To know, the steps of youth and mirth

Are thine, that pass me by.
II. Tamen.
