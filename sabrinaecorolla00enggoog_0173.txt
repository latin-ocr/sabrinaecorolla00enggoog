Sonnet.

This morning tin-:ely rapt with holy fite,
I thought to surm unte my zeulous Muse
What kind of creature 1 could most desire
To honour, serve, and love, as poets use.
I meant the day-star should not brighter rifle,
Nor lend like influence from his lucent seen
I meant each sostest virtue there should meet,
Fit in that zoster bosom to reside.
Only a lea-med and a manly seul
I purposed her, that should with even powers
The rock, the spindle, and the shears control
Of Destiny, und spin her own free hours:
Such when 1 meant to seign, and wished to see,
My Muse bade Bedsord write, aud that was she.

The Exile'r Return.

Art thou the strand 1 loved in early days,

The golden bench that saw my ehildish plays,
Home of my hem-t, when oceane rollcd between,
And still remembered, though so long unseen?
Art thou the strand? Art thou the strand?

O joy! thou art my own dear Fatherlund.
