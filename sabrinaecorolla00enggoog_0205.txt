 

SABRINAE COROLLA.

Evening.

It is the hom· when from the boughs
The nightingule's high note is hear-13
It is the haur when lovem= vows
Seem sweet in every whisper'd wouh
And gentle winda and wnters nont
Make music to the lonely ear.
Each flower the dews have lightly νεὶ,
And in the sky the stara are met,
And on the wave iz deeper blue,
And ou the leafe bmwner hue,
And in the heaven that clear obscure,
so softly ἀοι-1( and darkly pure,
Which follows the decline of day,
As tuilight melta bepeath the moon away.

The Μαι who had Noughl.

There was n man, and lue had nought,
And robbers came to rob him;

He got up the chimney-top,
And then they thought they had him.

He got down on th' other side,
And then they could not find him;
He ran sourteen miles in fifteen days,
And never looked behind him.
