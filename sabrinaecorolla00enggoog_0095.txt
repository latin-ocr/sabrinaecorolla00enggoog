Dame into Englim by Will Shalupeare.

Gaudes, petebanee you wonder ut this show5
But wonder on, tiu truth makes all things plain.
This uum is Pyramus, if you would know;
This beuuwous lady Thisby is, certain.
This man, with lime and rougheaat, deth present
WulL-—that vile wall that did these loven sunder.
And through wnll's chink, poor Βοιὼ, they nse content
To whisper3 nt the which let no num wonder,
This mun, with Lantem, dog, and bush of thom,
Pxesenteth moonshine3 for, if you will know,
By moonshine did these lovers think no scum
To meet nt Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
This grisly beust, which by nume lion hight,
The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
Did scal-e away, or rather did affright.
And aa she fied, her muntle she did sall;
Which lion vile with bloody mouth did stain z
Auen comes Pyramus, sweet youth and call,
And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle alain.
Whereat with blude, with bloody blamesul bhde,
He bravely broaehed his boiling bloody bream
And, Thisby tnrrying in mulbeny ulzade,
His dagget drew, and died. For all the rest,
Let lion, moonshine, wall, and lovers twain,
At luge discouxse, while here they do remain.

Pyr-amm.

Sweet Maon, I thauk thee sor thy suuuy beams3
Ι thnnk thee, Maon, for shining now so bright :
