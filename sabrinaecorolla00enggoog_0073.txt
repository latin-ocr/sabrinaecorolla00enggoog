The Sleep qs the Brave.

How sleep the brave, who sink ιο rest
By nll their country's wishes blest?
When Spring, with dewy fingers colel,
Baeturnz to deck their hfllovv'd mould,
She there shall dress a sweeter sod
Thau Fancy's feet have ever (sod.

By sairy hands their kuell is rung3

By forms unseen thei: ‹lix-ge is sung;
There Honour comes, a pilgrim gray,
To blesa the turs that wraps their clay ς
And Freedom shall awhile repair,

To dwell a weeping hcnnit there.

Epitaph on the Countm ofPembroke.

Undemeath this muble hemo

Lies the subject of all vexae3
Sidney's sister, Pembmke's mother:
Death, ere thou hast slain another
Fair, and good, ancl wisa as she,
Time shall throw a dart at thee!

uzu Jonson.
