206 SABRINAE COROLLA.

A Lover'a Liberty.

Away with those aelf-loving lads,
Whom Cupid’s arrow never glads!
Away poor souls that sigh and weep
ln love of those that lie asleep!

For Cupid is a merry god,
And forceth none to kiss the rod.

My songa they be of Cynthia's praise,

Ι wear her rings on holidays‚

In every tree I write her name,

And every day I read the same.
Where Honour Cupid's rival is,
There miracles are seen of his.

If Cynthia orave her ring of me,

I blot her name out os the tree;

If doubt do darken things held dear,

Then well-fare nothing once a year.
For many run, but one must win:

Fools only hedge the cuckoo in.

Barney Bodkin brohe his nose.

Want of victuals makes us sad.
Without feet we can't have toea.

Crazy folks are always mad.
