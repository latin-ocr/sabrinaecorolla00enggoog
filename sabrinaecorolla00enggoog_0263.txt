282 sananim: COROLLA.

lte Etrurian Noenio.

Where art thou, pale and melancholy ghost?

No funeral rites appense thy tombless clay3
Unburied, glidest thou by the dismal coast,
O exile from the day?

There where the voice of love is heard no more,
Where the dull ware moans back the eternal wail,
Dost thou recall the summer suns of yore‚
Thine own melodious vale?

Ἧι] lares stand on thy deserted floors,
And miss their last street daughter’s holy sace τ

What hand shall wreathe with flowers the threshold doors?
What child renew the racc?

Thine are the nuptials of the dreary shades;
Of all thy groves what restsl—the cypress tree?
As from the air a strain of music fades,
Dark silence buries thee.

Yet no, lost child of more than mortal sires,
Thy stranger bridegroom bears thee to his home,
Where the stara light the AEsar's nuptial fires
In Tina's azure ‹lome3 '

From the fierce ware the god’s celestial wing
Rapt thee aloft along the yielding air3
With amaranths fresh from heaven’s eternal spring

Bright Cupra braids thy hair.
