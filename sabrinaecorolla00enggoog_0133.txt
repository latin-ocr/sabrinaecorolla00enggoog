The Haunch os Veniam».

While thus 1 debat'ed, in revel-ie cerm-ed,

An acquaintance—a friend, ns he eall'd himself—enter'd;

An underbred, finmpoken fellow was he,

And he smiled as he louked nt the venison md me.

‘¹ What have we got luere? Why, this is good eating !

Your own, I suppose—or is it in waiting T'

“Why, whoee should it be Τ* exied 1, with n stennon

“ Ι get these things ofven''— but that was ο bounce:

“ Some lurda, my acquaintance, that settle the nat-ion,

Axe pleased tn be kind— but I hate ostentation.''

“ If that be the case, then,'' cried he, very gay,

¹‘ l'm glad to have taken this house in my way.

To-morrow you take a poor dinner with me;

No words—1 insist on't—precisely nt three:

We 'll have Johnson md Burke—all the wit! will be

there ;

My acquaintance is slight, or Γπ] ask my Lord Clare.

And, now that 1 think on't, as 1 :un a sinner,

We wanted this veniam] to make out a dinner.

What say you—n pusty? it shall and it must,

And my wife, little Kitty, is famous for crunt.—

Here, portet, this venison with nie to Mile-end ;—-

No stirring, 1 beg, rny dear friend, my dear friend !''

Thus snatching his hat, he brush'd off like the wind,

And the parter aud eatables follow'd behind.
