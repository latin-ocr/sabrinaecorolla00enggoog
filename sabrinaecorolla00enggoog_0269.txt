238 SABRINAE COROLLA.

A Rainy Day.

'she day is cold and ‹lark and dreary,

It mins, and the wind is never weary3

The vine still clings to the mouldering wall,
But at every gust the dead leaves fall;

And the day is dark and dreary.

My life is cold and dark and dreary,
It rains, and the wind is never weary3
My thoughts still cling to the mouldering past,
. But the hopes of youth fall thick in the blast,
And my days are dark and dreary.

Be still, sad heart, and cease repining3
Behind the clouds is the sun still shining:
Thy fate is the common fate of all;

Into each life some rain must fall,

Some days must be dark and dreary.

Lonesmow.

Charlie.

Over the water and over the lea,
And over the water to Charlie.

Charlie loves good ale and wine,
And Charlie loves good brandy

And Charlie loves a pretty lass,

As sweet as sugar-candy.
JAconmt Sota.
