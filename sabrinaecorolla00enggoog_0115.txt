My Boat ἰε on tloe Shooe.

My bont ia on the shore,
And my beu-k in ou the ιειις
But before 1 go, Tem Moore,
Here's a double health to thee!

Here's ι sigh to those who love me,

And a nuile vo those who hnte5
And, whatever sky 'a above me,
Here‘n a beart sor every fate.

Though the ocean rou- mund me,
Yet it still shall ben· me ους

Though a desert should sun-onnd me,
It had: springs that my be που,

Were ’t the last drop in the well,
As I gup'd upon the brink,
Ere my sainting spirits feu,
”ris ιο thee that I would dsink.

With that water, u this wine,
The libation 1 would pour
Should be—Peace with chine and mine,
Ami a health ιο thee, Tom Monte !
