SABRINAE COROLLA.

T he Beech· T ree’a Petilion.

Oh, leave this barren spot to me!

Spore, woodman‚ spare the beeehen tree!
Though bush or flowret never grow

My darl( unwarming shade below3

Nor summer bud perfume the dew

Of rosy blush, or yellow hue3

Nor fruits of autumn, blossom-born‚

My green and glossy leaves adorn3

Nor murmuring tribes from me derive
The ambrosial amber of the hive;

Yet leave this barren spot for me:

Spare, woodman‚ spare the beeehen trae!

Thrioe twenty summere I have seen
The shy grow bright, the forest green3
And many a wintry wind have stood
In bloomless‚ fruitless solitude‚

Since childhood in my pleasant bower
First spent its sweet and sportive hour,
Since youthful lovers in my shade
Their vows of truth and rapture made3
And on my trunk's surviving frame
Carved many a long-forgotten name.
Oh! by the sighs of gentle souud‚
First breathed upon this sacred ground3
By all that Love has whisper’d here,
Or Beauty heard with ravish'd ear;

As Love’s own altar, honour mo:

Spare, woodman‚ spare the beeehen tree!
Cauarum.
