Ode on Solitude.

Huppy the man, whom winh md aare
A few patema] acres bound ς
Cantent to bre-the his native nir
In his own ground.

Whose herda with milk, whose field! with bled.
Wbuse ssocks supply him with κύμη
Whose trees in summer yield him aha-⁴10,
In winter ἦτε.

Blest, who can unconcern'dly find
Huurs, days, and γεω slide sost away,
In health os body, peace of mind,
Quiet by day,

Sound sleep by night; study and ease
Togcther mixt; sweet τεθνεώσης
And innoeence, which most doch pleae,
With medimtion.

Thus let me livey uuseen, unknown,
Thus unlnsncnted let me die,
Steal from the world, and not a stoue
Tell where I lie.
Pom.
