Horatius Cocles.

NVhen the oldest mk is opened,
And the largest lump is lit;
&Vhen the chestnuts glow in the embers,
And the kid turns on the spit;
When young and old in tircle
Around the firebrands close;
W⁷hen the girls ure weaving baskets,
And the luds are uhupiug bows;
When me goodman mends his urmour,
Ami trima his helmet's plume;
When the goodwii'e's shuttle merrily
Goes ssashing through the loon„
With weeping and with laughtcr
still is the story told,
How well Horatius kept the bridge
In the bravo days os old.

17αηιίενον’3 Nachtlied.

Geutle Peuce, whose wand of power
Lulls to slumber woe and pain,

In affliction's sternest hour
Thou must soothe the wildered brain.

Here I wandel· tempest-driven,
Seeking comfort, sceking resn
ehfld os Hem-cn,
Glide, O glide into my breast!
K. (βω. Gom-n)
