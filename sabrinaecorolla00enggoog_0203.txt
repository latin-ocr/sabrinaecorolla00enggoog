The Paithlm K night.

To whom replied King Arthur, much in wmtlu:

Ah, misernble aud unkind, unu-ue,

Unknightly, traitor-hearted! Woe is me!

Authority surgen a dying king,

Laid widowed of the power in his eye

That bowed the will. I see thee what thou ast.

For thou the latest left ofall my knights,

In whom should meet the offices os all,

Thou wouldst betray me for the precious him

Esther from lust of gold, or like a girl

Valuing the giddy pleasuxe of the eyes.

Yet sor a man may fail in duty twice,

And the third time may prosper, get thee hence:

But is thou spate ιο fling Exealibur,

I will arise aud shy thee with my hands.
Tama.
