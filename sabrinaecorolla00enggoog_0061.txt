ΤΙιι Lea-Rig.

When o'er the hiu the eastern tm·
Tells bughtin'-time is near, my jo ;
And owsen Irae the fun-ow'd field
Remum sae dowf and wamy, O!
Down hy the burn, where scented birks
Wi' dew are hangin' clear, my jn,
I'u meet thee on the lea-rig,
My nin kind dende, 0!

In mirkest glen, at midnight hou:
I‘d πονε aud ne'ex be aede, 0!

If through that glen I gueni to thee,
My aiu kind dem-ie, 0!

Although the night were ne'er sae wild,
And 1 were ne'er sae wem-y, O!

I'd meet thee on the lea-fig,
My ain kind dem-ie, O!

The hunter lo'es the mornin' sun,

To muse the mountain ἀρετ, my jo3
At noun the fisher seeks the glan,

Almg the bum to steer, my jo.
Gi'e me the bour of gloamin' gray,

It makes my hem sae eheerie, O !
To meet thee ou the lea-rig,

My ain kind dean-ie, 0!

 

Nohody at Home.
