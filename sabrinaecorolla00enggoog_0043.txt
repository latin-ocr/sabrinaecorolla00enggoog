No change, ιιο pause, uo hope! Yet 1 endure.
I uk the earth, have not the mountain! felt?
I uk yon heaven, the all-beholding sun,

Has it not seen? The naen, iu norm or alm,
Heuveu's ever-changing shadovn spread below,
Hwe iu deas waves not heard my agony?

Ah me! alu, pain, puin ever, sor ever!

The crawling glaciem pierce me with the spem

of their moon-freezing crystaln the bright chains
Est with their burniug cold inm my bones,
Heaveu's winged hound, polluti-ag from thy [ipa

His benk in poison not his own, tem up

My heart; und shnpeless sights come wandel-ing by,
The ghmly people of the realm os dream,

Moekiug me: md the eurthquake fienda are clm-geni
To wreuch the τίνεις frum my quivering woundn«
