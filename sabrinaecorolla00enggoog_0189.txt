A maiden sair in days οἱ eld
Bemomed her hnpless fate:

The n're of gods and meu beheld
With eye compassionum.

Forthwith transmuted to a bird,
Her deffly wurbled ule

In many n forest-glatie is heard:
She is—the Nightingale.

It so seu out, one summer’s day,
Beneath a verdun hin,

She tuned her fullest, sweetest hy,
A conmrt's heart to thrill.

Love drank the liquid nutes, and strove
From that delicium haur

To work, in rivalry of Jove,
Α deed of equa} power.

The bird, whose music rich and rare
Entranced the listening wind,

He changed into a maiden fain
And she is—Jsmw an.
