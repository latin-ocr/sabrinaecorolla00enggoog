The fleme, the stom, the qualring ground,
Earth’s joy, earth’s terror, nought is thine 3

Of the still voice divine.

Thus to forecast in heart
Heaven’s age of fearless rest.

They that go down to the sea in shipn,

And do business in great waters3

These men see the works of the Lord,

And his wonders in the deep.

For at his word the stormy wind arisoth,

Which lifteth up the waves thereos.

They are carried up to the heaven, and down again to
the deep:

Their soul melteth away because of their trouble.

They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunhen man,

And are et their wit's end.

So when they cry unto the Lord in their trouble,

He delivereth them out of their distress.

For he maketh the storm to ccase,

So that the waves thereoi ere still.

Thcn are they glad because they are at rest:

And sobhebringeth them to the haven where they would
