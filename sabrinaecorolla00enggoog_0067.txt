The Fond Loner.

Why so pale und wan, fond lover?
Prithee, why so pale T

Will, when lacking well can't move her,
Looking ill prevuil?
Prithee, why so pale?

Why w dun and mute, young sinuer?
Prithee, why so mute?

wiu, when speaking well cm't win her,
Say-ing nothing do't?
Prithee, why so mute?

Quit, quit for shame5 this will not move,
This cannot take her:

If of herself she will not love,
Nothing can make her.
Let who will take her!

In a Churchyard αι Elgin.

Life is a city with many fl sta-een

Death is the market where all men meet :

Is Life were a thing which gold could buy,

The poor could not live, and the rich would not die.
