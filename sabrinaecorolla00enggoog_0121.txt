The Pan-iot.

Ye eldat gods,
Who, mindful of the empire which γε h'eld
Over dim chaos, keep revengeful wanoh
On falling natium, and on kingly linea
About to εἰκὼ for even-5 ye, who :hed
Inm the passions of εει-*ΗΕ gin-ut brood,
And their fierce usages, the sense ofjuntice3
Who clothe the fate-⁴1 battlement! οἰ tyrnnny
With blflekness az u funeral pull, and breathe
Thmugh the prum-l haus os Ama-embolden'd guilt
Pon-tenes of ruin, henr me! In your presence,
For now I feel ye nigh, I dedicate
This nrm to the destruction of the king
And of his tace! O keep me pitiless!
Expel all human weakneu stom my frume,
That this kaeu weapon shake not when hi, beart
Slwuld feel its point; and if he has a child
Whose blood is needful tu the sacrifice
My country aska, huden my mul to shed it!

Who never said a fooliah thing,
And never did a wize one.
