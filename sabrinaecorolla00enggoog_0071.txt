 

³⁸ SABRINAE COROLLQ

still mile, γε kind blue skies,
Though your son pines und dies—

Far o'er the sea!
Mus. Hamus.

The Braes os Yarroeo.

Ο Yarrow fields, may never rain
Nor dew thy tendet hlossoms cover,
For there was bmly §lain my luve,
My luve, as he'd not been a lover.

Much 1 rejoyced that wnefu' dam

1 sang, my voice the woods returning:
But lang ere night the spem· was flown

Thnt slew my luve, mu] left me mouming,

Yet, oh, prepare the bed of luve,
With bridal sheets my body cavel-5

Unbar, γε bridal maidz, the door,
Len in the expected husband-lover.

But who the expected husband is?

His hands, methinks, are bathed in slaughter:
Ah me! what ghastly spectre's you

Come: in his pale filu-oud, bleeding after?

Pale aa he is, here lay him down3

Oh lay his cold head on my pillow5
Take aff, take aff these brida] weida,

And erown my careful head with willow.

Hammon.
