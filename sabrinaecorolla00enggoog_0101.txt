But hand in hund we'll go,
And sleep thegither at the suot,

John Anderson myjo.

The Lion and tlte Unicorn.

The lion md the unieorn
Were fighting sor the crown ς
The lion beat the unicum
All round the town.
Some gave him white bread3
Sume gnve him brown3
Some gave him plum-oake,
And sent him out of town.
