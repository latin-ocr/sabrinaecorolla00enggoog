Let us love.

O wedding-guest! this mul bath been
Alone ou u wide, wide sen:

So lonely ἐπει, that Gnd himself
Source seemed there to be.

oh, sweeter than the man-inge-seast,
’Τίε sweeter far ιο me,

To welk together to the kirk
With ι guodJy compa-ny Ε

To welk together ω the kirk,
And all together pray;
While each to his great Futher bends,
Old men und babes, and leving friends,
And youths and maidens gay!

Farewell, sarewell! but this I vell
To thee, thou wedding-guest!

He prayeth well who loveth well
Both meu, and bird, und beust.

He prnyeth best who loveth best
All things, both great and smalh
For the dem· God who loveth us,
He uude md loveth nu.
