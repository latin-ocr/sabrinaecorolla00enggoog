⁴6 SABmNAE coneum

To Eum.

Though time has not wreathed
My templ-³⁸ with snow,

Though age hm· not breathed
A spel] οέι· my brom

Yet εει-ὼ wither'd fingexs
Press on me with paim

The sseeting pube lingers,
And lingers in vain.

The eyes which behold thee,
Their brighmess is flown;
The arms which enfold thee,
Enfeehled are grown ς
And friendzhip bath lest me,
By fortune est-tanges} ;
All, all is bel-eft me,
For thou too nt changed.

Yes, dax-k ills have clouded
The thwning iu tem ;
Advenity shroudecl
My ripening yem3
Life's path, wild and dreary,
Draws uigh to in close;
Haut-broken and weury,
I sigla sor repone.

The world shall eux-ess thee,
When I eene to be;

And sum riae to bles* thee,
Which smile not sor me3
