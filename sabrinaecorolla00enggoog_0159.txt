§ABRINAE conor-LA.

T a Alary in Heaven.

Thou lingering stur, with less'ning ray
Thac lov'st to greet the eusly mom,
Again thou usheresr. in ὼε day
My Mury from my soul was tom.
0 Mary, deur deparvegi ahude!
NVhere is thy place of blissful rest?
See'st thou thy lover lowly laid?
Hom-'st thou the gruans that tend hin baut ἰ

That snex-ed bour can I surget,

Can 1 surget the hauowed grove,
WVhere by the windjng Ayr we met,

To live nne day of parting love?
Etemity will not offnce

Thone records deas os transports pnsu
Thy image at our last embrace—

Ah, little thought we 'twas om· lust!

Ayr gurgling kiss'd his pebbled shore,
O'erhung with wild wuods thick'ning greum
The fragrant hirch und hawthorn hoa:
Twined amor->us round the ruptured scena
The ssowers sprung wauton to be preat,
The birds sang love on every ιρι-πῃ
Til] tuo, too soon, the glowing west
Proclaim'd the speed os winged day.

still o'er these soenes my mem’ry wukes,
And fondly hroods with miser cure5

Time but the impressio„ deepcr makes,
As strenms their channeh dceper wear.
