The Exile.

Night wnneth fast, the morning star
Snddens with light the glimm'ring sea,

W‘hose waves shall soon to reulms asar
wast me from hope, from love, and thee.

Coldly the beam from yonrler sky

Looks o'er the wuves that onward stmy5
But eolder still the ntrmger's eye

To him whose home is far away.

Oh, not at hom· so chill und blenk

Let thoughts os me come o'cr thy breast;
But os the lost one think und speak

When summer suns sink επὶ-11]] to τεεί.

80, as I wander, fancy's dream
Shall bring me o'er the sumet sen
Thy look in every melting heum,
Thy whisper in each dying breeze.
