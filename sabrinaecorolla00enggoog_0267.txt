236 SABRINAE COROLLA.

Tre Deatlr eff tle Brave.

Farewell‚ thou fair day, thou green earth, and ye okies,

Now gay wn'th the bright setting sun3
Farewell, loves and friendships‚ ye dear tender ties;
Our race of existence is run.

Thou grim king of terrore, thou life's gloomy foe,
Gn, frighten the coward and slave ;

Go, teach them to tremble, fell tyram, but know
No terrors hast thou to the brave.

Thou strik’st the dull pensant, he sinks in the dark,
Nor saves e‘en the wreck of a name3

Thou strik‘st the young hero—a glorious mark-
He falls in the blaze of his farne.

In the field of proud honour, our swords in our hands,
Our king and our country to save,
While victory shines on life’s last ebbing sande,

Oh, who would not rest with the breve?
Moonr.

—-—--—

οη a Laurel beside o Fonntain.

Rest thee beneath yon laurel’s ample shade,
And quaff the limpid stream that issues there3
So thy worn frome, for sumnrer's toil repaid‚

May feel the freshness of the western air.

Honoson ( from tle Greek Antloloyy).
