Bees.

Thea-esore doth Henven divide
The state of man iu divers funetions,
Setting endeavour in continual mutium
To which iz fixed, as an aim or butt,
Ohedienee: for so work the honey-beea;
C reatui-es that, by a rule in nature, teaeh
The net of order to a peopled kingdom.
They have ι king, and officers of sorta:
Where some, like magistrates, correct at home ;
Others, like mel-charite, venture trude nbroath
Others, like snldiers, armed in their nings,
Make boot upon ssie summer's velvet budn
Which pillage they with merry masch bring home
To the tent royal οἱ their emperort
Who, busied iu his maja-ny, nurveys
The singing masons building rooss of gold3
The civil citizens knending up the honey;
The poor mechania portel-s crowding iu
Their heavy burdons at his nuri-ow gurm
The sad-eyed justice, with his sui-ly hum,
Delivering o'er to executore paJe
The luzy yawning drone.

Coele Robin.

Who killed Cock nabin?
I, says the Spmow,
With my bow and ari-ow,
I killed Coek Robin.
