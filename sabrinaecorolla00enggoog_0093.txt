60 SABMNAE cononum<

 

To the N ightingale.

O Nightingule, that ou yon bloomy spx-ay
Wublest at eve, when all the wooda are still,
Thou with fresh hope the lover-'s hem dost fill,

While the jko Hom-s lead on propitium May.

Thy liquid notes, that close the eye of day,

Εἰπὲ heard before the shallow cuckoo's bill,
Pol-tend success in love; oh, if Jove's will

Have link'd that umorous power to thy sust lay,
Now timely sing, ere the rude bird of hate

Fotetell my hopeless duom, in some grove nigh;
As thou, from year to year, hast sung too late

For my relies, yet hadst no reason why:
whether the Muse or Love call thee his mute,

Both them I serve, and of their traiu am I.

Μιιτου.

Am Fluem.
