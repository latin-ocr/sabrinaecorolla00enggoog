204 SABRINAE COROLLA.

Peuce.

Now is the winter of our discontent

Made glorious summer by this sun of York3

And all the clouds that loured upon our house

In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.

Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths,
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments3

Our stem alarums changed to merry meetings,
Our dreadsul marches to delightful measures.
Grim·visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front3
And now‚—instead of mounting barbed steeds,
Το fright the souls of fearful adversaries,-

He capers nimbly in a lady’s chamber,

To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.

Sfflsmm.

Irffancy.

On parent knees, a naked new-born child,

Weeping thou sat’st‚ while all around thee smiled:
So live, that sinking to thy life’s last sleep,

Calm thou may'st smile, while all around thee weep.

sm W. Jomzs.
