Lines,

Untffinking, idle, wild, and young,

Ι laughed and daneed, and talhed and sung ς
And fond of health, of freedorn vain,
Dreamed not of sorrow, care, or pain 3
Concluding in those hours of glee '
·That all the world was made for me.

But when the hour of trial carne,

And sickness shook this trernbling frame3
When folly's gay pursuits were o’er,

And I could donce or sing no more 3——
It then occurred, how sad ’twould be,
Were this world only made for me.

Pnrncuss Arfflun on Enounun.

Sweet are the uses os Aduerrity.

I have been honoured ond obeyed,
I have met scorn and slight3

And rny heart loves earth's sober shade
More than her laughing light.

For what is rule but a sad weight
Of duty, aud a snare?

What meannesS, but with happier fate ’
The Saviour's cross to share?

This my hid choice, though not from heaven,
Moves on the heavenward line;

Cleanse it, good Lord‚ from sinful leaven,
And make it simply thino.

Lrnn Anosroucn.
