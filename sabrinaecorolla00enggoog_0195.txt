snm! NAE COROLLA.

A utumn.

The Antumn is uld,

The sere leaves are ssying5
He hath gnther'd up gold,
And now he is dying:
Old nge, begin sighing.

The vintage is ripe,

The harvest is heaping;
But some that have sow'd
Have no rinhes for renpingz
Poor wreteh, fall a weeping.

The γεω-ἐ in the wnne,
There is nothing anemium
The night has no eve,

And the day hus nu morning:
Coltl winter gives warning.

The rivers run chill,
The red sun is sinking,
And l am grown old,
And life is fast slirinking:
Here 's enow for sud thinking.

And shall they scorn Tre, Pol, and Pen,

And shall Trelawny die?

'l'hen twenty thousand Cornish men

Will know tlte reason why.
