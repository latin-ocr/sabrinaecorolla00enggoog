SABMNAE COROLLA.

Song.

Go, soz-get me: why should sorrow

O'er that brow a shndow fling 2

Go, surget me: and to-mortow

Brightly nuile and sweetly sing.
Smne—though I shall not be neu theu
sing—though 1 shall never hear thee:
May thy saul with pleasure ubine,
Luting u the glonm of mine.

Like the sun, thy presence glowing,
Clothes the meanest things in light;
And when thou, like him, art going,
Loveliest objects fade in night.

All things looked so bright about thee,
That they nothing seem without thee;
By that pure and lunid mind

Ean-thly things were too reflned.

Go, thou vision, wildly gleaming,
Snftly on my snul that fell3
Go, for me no longer hemming—
Hope and Beauty, sare ye well!
Go, and all that once delighted
Take, and leave me all benighted‚—-
Glory’s buming genez-uus well,
Faney, und the poet's shell.
Wours.
