2⁵ SABMNAE COROLLA.

The Lake lum burst.

The lake has burst! the lake has burst!
Down through the chasma the wild waves flec ς
They gallop along,
With a roal-ing song,
Away m the eager awaiting sea!

Down through the valleys, and over the rocks,
And over the forest-⁴1, the flood runs free;

And wherever it dushes,

The oaks and the ashes
Shrink, drop, and are borne to the hung-ry seu!

The contage uf reeds and the tower of stone,
Both shakeu to ruin, nt last agrem

And the slave and his master,

In one wide disaster,
Are hurried, like weeds, to the scomful rea!

The sea-beust he tosseth his fonming mane,
He hellows aloud to the misty sky;
And the sleep-buried Thunder
Awnkens in wonder,
And the Lightuing opens her pierciug eye!

⁴ There is death above, there is death around,
There is death wherever the waters be3
There is nothing now doing,
Save terror und min,
In earth, and in air, and the stoxmy sea!
