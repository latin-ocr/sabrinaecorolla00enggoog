'Hre Praise os God.

Ye mists aud exhalations, that now rise

From hill or steaming lake, dusky or grey
Till the suu paint your fleecy skirts with gold,
In honour to the world’s great Author rise3

Whether to deck with clouds the uncolour'd sky,
Or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers,
Rising or falling, still advance his pruise.

His praise, ye winds, that from four quarters blow,

Brenthe soft or loud3 and wave your tops, ye pines,
’ With every plant, in sign of worship ware.

Fountains, und ye that warble, ns ye flow,

Melodious murrnurs, warbling tune his praise.

Join voices, all ye living souls3 ye birds,

That singing up to heaven-gnte ascend,

Bear on your wings and in your notes his pruise.

Ye that in waters glide, and ye that walk

The earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep3

Witness if Ι be silent, morn or even,

To hill or volloy, fountain or fresh shade,

Made vocal by my song, and taught his praiso.

Muros.

The Porislr Prien! to ln‘s Successor.

lf thou dost find
A house built to thy rnind '
Without thy eost,
Serve thou the more
God and the poor,
My lnbour is not lost.
Hsnuuur.
