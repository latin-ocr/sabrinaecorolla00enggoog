224 SABRINAE COROLLA.

The Soldiery of Hell.

Theu straight commands, that, at the warlike souud
Of trunrpets loud and clarions, be uprear'd

His mighty standard: that proud honour claim'd
Azazel as his right, a cherub tall,

Who forthwith from the glittering staff unfurl'd
'lhe imperial ensign3 which, full high advanced,
Shone like a meteor streaming to the wind,

With gems and goldeu lustra rich emblazed,
Seraphin arms and trophies; all the while
Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds3

At which the universal host up-sent

A shout, that tore hell's concava, aud beyond
Frighted the reign of Chaos and old Night.

All in a moment through the gloonr were seen
Ten thousand banners rise into the air

With orient colours waving: with thern rose

A forest huge of spears; aud throngiug helms
Appear’d‚ and serried shields in thick array

Of depth immensurable: anon they move

In perfect phalanx to the Dorion mood

Of flutas and soft recorders3 such as raised

To height of noblest temper heroes old

Arming to battle3 and instead of rage‚

Deliberate valour breathed, firm and unmoved
With dread of death to ssight or foul retreat:

Nor wanting power to mitigate and ’suage

With solemn touclres troubled thoughtS, 3001 chase
Anguish, and doubt, sudsear, and sorrow, and pain

From mortal or immortal minda.
