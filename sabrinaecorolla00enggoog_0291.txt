Paalm cxxxix. 1-7.

0 Lord‚ thou hast searehed me out, arrd known me:
Thou krrowest rny down-sitting and mine up-rising;
Thou understaudest 111)ν thoughts long before.

Thou art about my path and about my bed,

And spiest out all my ways.

For lo there is not a word iu nry tongue.

But thou, Ο Lord‚ knowest it altogether.

Thou hast fashioned rue behind and before,

And laid thine haud upon rue.

Such knowledge is too wonderful aud excellent forme:

Whither shall l go then from thy Spirit,

Or· 1111111101 shall 1 go 110111 thy presence?

If l go 1101111 10 hell, thou art there also.
