Sonnet.

One day l wrote her nume upon the strand,
But name the ψῆνες and washed it uva„

'Agaiu Ι wrote it with a second hand,

But carne the tide and made my paim hi: prey.
“ Vain mans said she, “ that dost iu vain may
A morml thing so to immortalise ς

For I mynelf shall like to this deeay,

And eke my name be wiperl out likewise.''

‘⁴ Not so‚'' quoth 1; “ let bnser things devise
To die in dust, but you shall live by sume ε

My verse your virtues rare shall eterniue,

And in the hezvnns write your glutinus nume ς
ὶνὴεῐε, whenns death shall all the world subdue,

Our love shall live, and later life renew.''

The Parting G fi·

Take this ring, the simple token
Ofa true and leving heum

Could the :pell of fate be broken,
Never, never would we part.

Soon we lose whate'er is sweetest:
Soon we ring enjoymencs knell;

Fondest hopes are ever fleetest ;
Therefore, deas one, sare thee well.

K. (from the Gmm)
