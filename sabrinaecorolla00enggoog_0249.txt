Lycidas.

Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more,
For Lycidas your sorrow is not dead,

Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor3

So sinks the day-star in the ocean-hed,

And yet anon repairs his drooping head,

And tricks his beamS, and with new-spangled ore
Flames in the forehead of the morning shy:

So Lycidas sunl< low, but mounted high,
Through the dear might of Him that walk'd the waves
where, other groves and other streams along,
With nectar pure his oozy looks he laves,

And hears the unexpressive nuptial song,

In the blest kingdoms meeh of joy and love.
Mnnon.

Dirge.

F ear no more the heat o’ the sun,
Nor the furious winter’s rages:
Thou thy worldly task host done,
Home art gone, and ta’en thy weges.

Golden lads and girls all must,
As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.

Fear no more the frown o' the great;
Thou art past the tyrant’s stroke:
Care no more to clotho and eat3
To thee the reed is as the oak.
The sceptre, learning, physic, must
All follow this, and come to dust.

Snnnsnnnnn.
