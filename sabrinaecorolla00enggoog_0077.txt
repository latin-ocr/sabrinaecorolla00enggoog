SAmuNAE COROLLA*

T albot.

My thought! are like a potter'fl wheel3
1 know not where I am, or what Ι do.
A witch, by sear not force, like Hannibal,
Drives buck our troops, and conquers 1³2³ she lists:
So bees with smol-xe, and doves with noismne steuch,
Axe from their hivea and houses driven away.
They eall'd us, from our fiereeness, English dogs3
Now, like to whelps, we crying run away.
Hark, countrymen! either renew the fight,
Or tear the lion! out of Eugland's cuat3
Renounce your soil, give sheep in lions’ stead:
Sheep run not hals so timon-uus from the wolf,
Or hone or oxeu stom the leopard,
As you fly from your oft-subdued slaves.

Summum.

The Grave.

There is a calm fot those who weep,

A rest for wenry pilgrims found3

They wstly lie and sweetly deep
Low in the ground.

The sturm that wrecks the winter sky
No more disturbs their deep repom,
Thau summer eveniug's latest sigh
Thac shuts the rose.
