Tloe Battle os Hohenlindeu.

On Linden, when the sun was low,
All bloodless lay th* untrodden mow,
And dau-k aa winter wa: the Ωον

Of Iser, rolling rapidly.

But Linden saw another sight

When the drum beat at dead of night,

Commanding fires of death ω light
The darkness of her floenel-y.

By torah and trumpet fast muy'd,

Euda homonum drew his battle-blado,

And furious every charge: ueigh'tl
To jein the dreadsul revelry-

Then shook the hina with chun-ier riven,
Thea rush'd the stood to battle dn'ven,
And Iouder than the holm of heaven

Far flush'd the red artillery.

But reddet yet that light shall glow

On Linden's hills of stained snow,

And bloodier yet the torrent flow
Of Iser, rolling mpidly.

’Tis mom, but scal-ce yon level sun

Can pierce the war-clouds rolling dun,

Where furium Frank and fiery Hun
Shout in their sulph'rous canopy.
