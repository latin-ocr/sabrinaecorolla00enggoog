176 SABRINAE COROLLA.

Parisino.

But it is not to list to the waterlall

That Parisino leaves hor hall;

Audit is not to gaze on the heavenly light

'l'hat the lady vvalks in the shadovv of night3

And if she sits in Este¹s bovver,

’Tis not for the sake of its full-blown flower 3

She listens-but not for the nightingale,

Though her ear expects as soft a tale.

There glides a step through the foliage thick,

Aml her cheelr grows pale, and her heart beato quick 3
There vvhispors a voice through the rustling leaves,
And her blush returns and her bosom heaves:

A moment more, and they shall meet ;

'Tis past-her lover 's at her feet.

Mosque.

Spring all the graces of the ago,

And all the loves of time 3
Bring all the ploasures of tho stage,

And relishes of rhyme;
Add all the softnesses ol courts,
The looks, tho laughters‚ and the sports;
And mingle all the svveets and salta,
'l'hat none may say, The triumph halts.

Bra Jorsorv.
