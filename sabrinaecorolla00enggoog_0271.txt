240 SABRINAE COROLLA.

Ster aster δίαν decays.

How oft has the Benshee cried3

How oft has Death untied

Bright links that Glory wove,

Sweet bonds entwined by Love!
Peece to each manly soul that sleepeth3
Rest to each faithful eye that weepeth3

Long may the fair and brave

Sigh 0’er the hero’s grave!

We've fallen upon gloomy days,
Star after star decays3
Every bright name that shed
Light o'er the land is fied.
Derk falls the tear of him who mourneth
Lost joy or hope that ne’er returneth3
But brightly flows the tear
Wept o’er ahero's bier.

Oh, quenched are our beacon-lights:
Thou of the hundred fights3

Thou on whose burning tongue
Truth‚ peace, and freedom hung3
Both mute: but long as valour shineth,

Or mercy's soul at war repineth‚

So long shall Erin’s pride
Tell how they lived and died.

Mooee.
