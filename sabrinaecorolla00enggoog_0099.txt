Tlm Laud qs the Suu.

Know γε the land where the cypress and myrtle
Are cmblems of deeds that nte done in their clima
WVhere the rago of the vulture, the love of the tul-tle,
Now molt into son-ow, now madden to crime?
Kuuw ye tho land os the cedar and vine,
Where the ssowcrs ever blossum, the boumn ever shine;
XVherc the light wiugs of zephyr, oppressed with per-
sume,
VVax saint o'er the gardcns of Gal in her bloom ς
W'here the citron aud olive nte fnirest of fruit,
And the voice of tho nightingnle never is mute;
VVhere the tints of the carth, and thu huns of the sky,
In colour though varied, in beauty may vie,
And the purple of ocean is det-pest iu dye;
Where thr: virg-ins axe sost as the roses they twine,
And all, save the spirit of man, is divine? ’
'Tis the elimo of the East—'tis the Laud of the Suu3
Can he smile uu such deeds as his children have done ἲ
Oh! wild as the accents of 1overs' farewell
Are the hem-ts which they bear, aud the tales which

they tell,
Bx'non.
