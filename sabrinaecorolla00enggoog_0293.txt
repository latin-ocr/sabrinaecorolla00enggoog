SABRINAE COROLLA.

All Τ liings are Vanity.

When niirth is full and free,
Some sudden gloom will be:
When haughty power mounts high,
The watcher’s axe is nigh.
All growth has bound; when greatest found,
It hastes to die.

When the rich town, that long
Has lain its huts among,

Rears its new structures vast,
And vaunts,—it shall not last.
Bright tints that shine are but the sign

Of summer past.

When, too, thine eye survcys
With fond adoring gaze
And yearning heart thy friend,
Love to its grave doth tend.
All gifts below, save saith, but grow
Towards an end.
