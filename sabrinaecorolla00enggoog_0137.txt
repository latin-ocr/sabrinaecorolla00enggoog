The Hebrezv Monarch to his Ναννίου-ε.

Wnrrion and chiesa, should the shaft οι· the ενοι-δ
Pierce me in leading the host of the Lord,

Heed not the cone, though Α king'a, in your φιτ-1η
Bury your nteel in the hosnms of Goth.

Thou who art bem-ing my buckler and how,

Should the sold-iem of Suu] look away from the foe,
Stretch me that moment in blood at thy feet;

Mine be the duom which they dated not to meet.

Farewell to others ; but never we part,
Heir to my royalty‚ son of my ἣρω-ις ¹
Bright is the diadem, boundless the sway,
Or kingly the death which awaits us to-day.

Emon.

Song.

A widow bird sat mouruing for her love
Upon a wintry bough ;

The frozen wind kept ou above,
The freezing stream below.

There was no leaf upon the forest bate,
No flower upon the ground·,
And little motion in the ait,

Except me mffl-wheel's mund.
Suu-⁸¹.
