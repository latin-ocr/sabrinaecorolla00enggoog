The Primrose.

Ask me why I send you here

This firstling of the infant γεω

Ask me why Ι send to you

This primrose all bepearl’d with dew;

Ι straight will whisper in your ears,

The sweets of love are wash'd with tears.

Ask me why this flower doth show
So yellow, green, and sickly too;
Ask me why the stalk is weak,

And bending, yet it doth not break3
Ι must tell you, these discover

What doubts and fears are in a lover.

ΟΜ.

Serenade.

Hark, hark‚ the lark at heaven’s gate sings,
And Phoebus 'gins arise,

His steeds to water at those springs
On chaliced flowers that lies:

And winking marybuds begin
To ope their golden eyes;
With every thing that pretty bin3
My lady sweet, arise.
Summas.
