SABRINAE COROLLA.

Drinlting Song of Munich.

Sweet Iser‚ were thy sunuy realm
And flowery gardens mine,

Thy waters Ι would shade with elm,
To prop the tender vine3

My golden flagons I would fill

With rosy draughts from every hill;
And under every myrtle-bower

My gay companions should prolong

The laugh, the revel, and the song,
To many an idle hour.

Like rivers erimsoned with the beam
Of yonder planet bright,
Our balmy cups should ever stream
Profusion of delight.
No care should touch the mellow heart‚
And sad or sobernone depart3
For wine can triumph over woe,
And Love aud Bacchus, brother powerS‚
Could build in Iser's sunuy bowers
A paradise below.
Caurum.
