T 1ae Silent Laud.

Into the Silent Land!
Ah, who shall lead us thither?
Clouds in the evening sky more dorkly gather,
And shotter'd wrecks lie thicker on the strand.
Who leads us with a gentle hand

Thither, oh thither,

Into the Silent Land?

Into the Silent Land!

To you, ye boundless regions

Of all perfection, tendet moming visions
Of beauteous 001110, eternity's own band.
Who in life's 001110 firm doth stand,

Sholl bear hope’s tendor blossoms
Into the Silent Land.

Ο Land! O Land!
For all the broken-hoarted
The mildest herald by our fate allotted
Beckons‚ and with invented torch doth stand,
To lead us with a gentle hand
Into the land of all the great departed‚

Into the Silent Land!

Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, Peace in thy breast!
Would Ι were Sleep and Peuce, so sweot to rest.
