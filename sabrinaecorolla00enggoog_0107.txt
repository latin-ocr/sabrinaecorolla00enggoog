Gratitude.

What is grandem, what is power!
Heavier toil, superior puin.
What the bright reward we gain?
The grateful memory of the gootL
Sweet is the breath of vex-nal nhower,
The bee's collected neuun-es meet;
Sweet muzic'fl melting fall ; but meeter yet
The still small voice of gratitude.
Gur.

Melody.

Though the hezd have ssed from thee, thy home iu stin

And the bean md the hand all thy own m the lut.

Oh, what wu love made for, if 'tis not the sume
Through joy and through tormenta, through glory aud
1 knowsgsselfuk not, if guilt's in that beart-
1 but know that 1 love thee, whntever thou art.

Thou hut eall'd me thy angel in moment! of bliss,
And thy angel I'll be, 'mid the horrore of thiu

'through the furnuce, unshrinking, thy steps to punue,
And ahield thee, md save thee, or—perixh there too.
