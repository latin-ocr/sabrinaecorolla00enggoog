264 SABRINAE COROLLA.

Christian Warsare.

Soldier, go—but not to claim
Mouldering spoils of earth-horn treasure,
Not to build a vaunting name,
Not to dwell in tents of pleasure3
Dream not that the way is smooth‚
Hope not that the thorns are roses3
Turn no wishful eye of youth
Where the sunny beam reposes:
Thou hast sterner work to de,
Hosts to cut thy passage through3
Close behind thee gulfs are burning:
Forward Ξ —there is 110 returning.

Soldier‚ rest-but not sor thee
Spreads the world her downy pillow;
On the rock thy eouch must be,
While around thee chafes the billow;
Thine must be a watehful sleep,
Wearier than another's waking3
Such a charge as thou dost keep
Brooks no moment of forsaking.
Sleep‚ as ou the battle-field,
(ih-ded, grasping swerd and shield:
These thou canst not name or number
Steal upon thy broken slumher.

Soldier, rise—the war is done:
Lo, the hosts of hell are flying3
’Twas thy Lord the battle w0n3
J esus vanquished them by dying.
