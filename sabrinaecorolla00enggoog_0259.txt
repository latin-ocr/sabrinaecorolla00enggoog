228 SABRINAE COROLLA.

Funeral Honoma. ι

Oh, think not that with garlanda crown’d
Inhumau near thy grave we tread3

Or blushing roses scatter round,
To mach the paleness of the dead.

What though we drain the fragrant bowl,
In flowers adorn'd and silken vest,

Oh, think not, brave departed soul,
We revel to disturb thy rest.

Feign'd is the pleasure that appears,
And false the triumph of our eyes,
Our draughts of joy are dash'd with tears,
Our songs imperfect and in sighs.

We inly mourn : 0’er flowery plains
To roam in joyous trance is thine,
And pl'easures uuallied topatius,

Unfading sweets, immortal wine.
Brenn.

On a Pipe in the Temple ⁰s Venus.

Say, rustic Pipe, in Cytherea's dome

Why sounds this echo of a shepherd's home?
Nor rocks nor valleys here invite the straiu;
But ull ia Leve—go aeek thy hilla again.

Honason (from the Greek Antholopy).
