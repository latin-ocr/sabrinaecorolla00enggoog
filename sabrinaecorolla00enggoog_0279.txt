The Year.

In childhood, when, with eager eyes,
The season-measured year I viewed,
All, garbed in fairy guise,
Pledged constaney of good.

Spring sang of heaven; the summer flowers
Let 1ne gaze on, and did not fade3
Even suns 0'er antumn's bowers
Heard my strong wish, and stayed.

They came and went, the short-lived four;
Yet, as their varying dance they nove,
To my young heart each bore
Its own sure claim of love.

Far different now !—the whirling year
Vainly my dizzy eyes pursne,
And its fair tints appear
All blent in one dusk hue.

Why dwell on rich autumna} lignes,
Spring-tinne, or winter's social ring?
Long days are fireside nights‚
Brown autumn is fresh spring.

Then what this world to thee, 1ny beart?
Its gifts nor seed thee nor can bless3
Thou hant no owner's part
ln all its sseetingness.
