SABMNAE conomm.

Martinmau.

It is the day os Murtelman
Cupn of ale should freely pass.
What though winter has begun
To push down the summer suu?
To our fixe we can betake,

And enjoy the crackling bruke,
Never heeding winter'n face

On the day os Martelmas.

Some do the city now frequent,
Whern costly shows aud mel-timent
Do wear the vapourish evening out
With interludo and rcvelliug rout,
Such as did pleasure Eugland's queen,
When here her royal grace was seem
Yet will they not this day let pass,
The marry day of Martelmaa.

When the dajly spol-ts be done,
Round the market-cross they run,
Prentice lads and gallam blades
Daneing with their gumesome maa-idn
Till the beadle, stout und suut,
Shakes his bell, and calls the hom-3
Then fasewell lad and furewell lass
To the men-y night of Martelmas.

Martelmas shall nome again,

Spita of wind and snow and raim

But many a strange thing must be done,
Many a cause be lost and won,
