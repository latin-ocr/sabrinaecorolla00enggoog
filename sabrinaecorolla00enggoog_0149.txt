T he Poor &halat-'s Song.

Deaffi, old fellow! have we then
Come at lant ιο neas each other?
Wen, shake hmds; md be m me

A quiet friend, a faithful brother.

All those merry days are gone,

Gone with cusl- und health, old fellow,
When I read long days and nights,

And sometimes <with a friend) got melluw.

Newmn! Euclid! fine old ghmts!
Noble books uf old Greek learning!
Ah, ye left huge aches behind,
Head and beart and brnin ull buming.

How I wiled! For one now fied

I wore down the midnight tepet,
Labouring, dreuming3 till one day

1 wake, and found my life —a vapour.

Yet I hoped (ah, laugh not now !)

For wealth and health and fame—the bubble !
So 1 elimbed up wisdom's aequa,

And got a fau, boy, sor my trouble.

Now all's over. No one helped,

No one cheered my strong endeavouu
So I sank, and called on thee,

And thou'lt he my friend sor ever.
