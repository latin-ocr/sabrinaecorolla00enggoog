Ὶῦ summu: COROLLA.

T Ιιε Wronged Huslmnd.

Had it plefised heaven
To try me with nffliction; had he raiued
All kinds of sores and shames on my bare hauh
Stoep'd me in poverty to the very lips:
Given to eaptivity me and my utmost hopes ς
Ι should have found in some place of my seul
A dsop of patience: but, αἰκὲς, to make me
A flxed figure sur tho haud os soom
To point his sIow unmoving finger at,—
0! O!
Yet could Ι bear that too5 well, very well :
But there where I have garner'd up my hem-n
Where either I must live, or bear no lise;
The sountaiu from the which my current runs,
Or else dries up ; to be discarded thence l
Patiencc, thou young and rose-lipp'xl cherubim,

Ay, there, look grim as hell!
Snusnzm,
