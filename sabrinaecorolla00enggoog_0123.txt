T lge Chase.

Now my breve youths,
Now give a lonse to the elcan genereus steed,
Flourish the whip, nor spure the galling epum
But in the mndness of delight forget
Your fem. Fas 0‘er the rneky hius we range,
And dangerous our course ; but in the brave
True couruge never fans. In vain the stream
In fouming eddies whirls: in vain the ditch
Wide gasping, threatens death. The craggy steep,
Where the poor dizzy shepherd crawls with cate,
And clings tu every twig, gives us no paim
But down we sweep, as stoops the falcon bold
To pounce his prey. T hen up the opponent hill,
By the swift motion slung, we mount alost:
So ships in winter seu now sliding sink
Adown the steepy wave, theu toes'd on high,
Ride on the billows, aud desy the storm,

What lengths we pass! Where will the wandel-ing
chase
Lead us bewilder'd? Smooth us swallows skim
The new-shorn mend, and far more swift, we fly.
see my breve pack: now to the head they press,
Josth'ng in close array, then more diffuse
Obliquely whcel, while from their opening mouths
The vollied thunder breaks. So when the ornnes
Their annual voyage steer, with wauton wing
Their figure ost they change, and their loud clang
From cloud to cloud rebounds.
Somnum-nl.
