2³0 SABRINAE COROLLA.

Enton. Boliogbrolte.

E. Great king, within this coffin Ipresent
Thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies
The mightiest of thy greatest enemies‚
Richard of Bourdeanx‚ by me hither brought.

B. Exton‚ l thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
A deed of slander with thy fatal hand
Upon my head eud all this famous land.

Ε. From your own mouth, my lond, Ι wrought this

deed.

B. They love not poison that do poison need,
Nor do l thee: though Ι did wish him dead,
I hate the murderer, love him murdered.
The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour,
But neither my good word nor princely favour:
With Cain go wonder through thc shode of night,
And never shew thy head by day nor light.
Lords‚ l protest my soul is full of woe
That blood should sprinkle mc to make mc grow.
Come mourn with me for what Ι (10 lament,
And put on sullen blech incontinent.
I’ll make a voyage to the Holy Laud,
To wash this blood off from my guilty hand.
March sndly after: grace my mournings here,
In weeping after this untimely bier.

Srmnsnmnn.

Love is a circle that doth ever move

In the same sweet eternity of Love.
